# An Analysis of PyBer Ride-Sharing Data

## Overview of Project

This project analyzes data from the ride-sharing company, PyBer, to calculate and visualize the total weekly fares earned in urban, suburban, and rural cities.

## Results

Urban cities have by far the most rides, drivers, and subsequently fares in comparison to suburban and rural cities, as can be seen in the chart below.
